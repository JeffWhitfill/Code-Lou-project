# Code-Lou-project

A website to illustate TaiChi for Neurological issues.  Norton Healthcare has a class that is designed for people with Mulyiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, stroke survivors, and their caregiveers.  This site provide information of the topics and examples from the class.

The site utilizes containers which are all styled using css and media queries come into play when the browser window is the size of a cell phone screen (a button is displayed in the bottom 2 containers and the code in those continers disappears).  When  the button is pressed, the steps to that exercise are revealed and the button disappears thanks to JaveScript code.

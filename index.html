        <h4>Explanation of Yin Yang Symbol</h4>
        <p>The white and black represent the balance of life.  The whole is greater than either half<br>
            You can think of it as gathering energy vs expending energy.  The dark side is thought of as the feminine<br>
            side or gathering side where as the light side is the masculine side and expending energy.<br>
            <br>
            The two dots in each figure are to illustrate the presence of the other energy within it.<br>
            Energy needs to be gathered before it can be expelled.

        <p>In my Neuro Tai Chi class, we primarily study Yang style, specifically the 16 form.

        <br> 
        <p>With Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's especially, it has been proven that movement, like those in Tai Chi<br>
            reduces the impact of symptoms along with a healthy diet and a positive attitude</p>

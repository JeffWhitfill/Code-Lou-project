                    <h4>Explanation of Yin Yang Symbol</h4>
                    <p>The white and black represent the balance of life.  The whole is greater than either half.  
                        You can think of it as gathering energy vs expending energy.  The dark side is thought of as the feminine
                        side or gathering side where as the light side is the masculine side and expending energy. 
                        The two dots in each figure are to illustrate the presence of the other energy within it.
                        Energy needs to be gathered before it can be expelled.

                <h4>Tai Chi Walk</h4>
                <p>You may wander why there is a specific Tai Chi walk since we learned to walk when we were about 1 or 2 years old.  The problem is we had improper instruction.
                    If you go to a shoe store where they measure feet to fit the shoe/boot perfectly to your feet, they will undoubtedly notice that your current shoe has an uneven
                    tread.  For most people, this phenomenon doesn't affect their daily life.  For someone with a neurological disease this could cause back pain, hip pain and even 
                    a fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you watch someone who has studied Tai Chi for a while, you'll notice that when they walk, their head remains still and doesn't bob up and down.  They could walk
                    up a flight of stairs and appear as if they were riding an escalator.  They move like a river, flowing from point A to point B without impediment.
                    The goals of practicing a Tai Chi walk is to improve balance and endurance.

            <p>With any neurological disease, especially Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, it has been proven that movement, like in Tai Chi,
            reduces the impact of symptoms of the disease.  Along with a healthy diet and a positive attitude, practicing Tai Chi even at a beginner level
            can greatly increase the quality of one's life.</p>
